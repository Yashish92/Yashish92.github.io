Yashish M. Siriwardena received the honors degree in biomedical engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 2017. He is currently a Ph.D. candidate in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, working with [Carol Espy-Wilson](https://isr.umd.edu/clark/faculty/391/Carol-Espy-Wilson) and [Shihab Shamma](https://isr.umd.edu/clark/faculty/476/Shihab-Shamma).

Yashish's research is primarily on speech communication. He combines knowledge of digital signal processing, speech science, linguistics, acoustic phonetics and machine learning to conduct interdisciplinary research in speech production, speech synthesis and speech inversion. He has also worked in using speech as a behavioral signal for emotion recognition, and the detection and monitoring of mental health.
